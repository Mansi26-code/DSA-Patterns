        int k = accumulate(data.begin(), data.end(), 0); // total number of 1s

        // ðŸ§  Step 2: Use sliding window of size k to find the window which already contains

                }
                left++; // Slide the window forward
            }

            // ðŸ‘‰ Update max number of 1s found in a window of size k
            if (right - left + 1 == k) {
                maxOnes = max(maxOnes, count);
            }
        }

        // âœ… Step 3: Minimum swaps required = total 1s - maximum 1s already together
        // Because only the remaining 1s need to be swapped inside the window
        return k - maxOnes;
    }
};

ðŸ“Š Time Complexity:
O(n) where n is the size of the input array.

One pass to compute total number of 1s using accumulate().

One pass using sliding window logic.

ðŸ§  Space Complexity:
O(1) constant space.

We only use a few integer variables for tracking window state.
